        University Student Senate. I am the voice for the students and I am here to have you
        fill out a simple survey about your time here at Lewis University. The questions should
        be simple to answer and will help me make this University a better place. The student
        voice is the most important because while you are at Lewis University, it should be
        all about you. You are here to finish your schooling, and we want to help make this the

Below is how I tried to make it submit to my email, I was having trouble with creating a solution to this.
I was thinking it maybe because I was using Azure, but I'm not sure. Through Fromsubmit, I was getting
a message that stated I was in an HTML file and need to be in a web browser. I tried opening the
website from Azure and I was still having the same issue.
